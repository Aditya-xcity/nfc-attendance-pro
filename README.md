# Tap & Track: NFC-Enabled Attendance Management System

## Project Overview
**Tap & Track** is an automated attendance management system that leverages **NFC (Near-Field Communication)** technology to streamline attendance tracking. Designed for educational institutions and workplaces, this system eliminates manual roll calls and provides accurate, real-time attendance records.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance:** Users simply tap their NFC-enabled ID card to mark attendance.
- **New User Registration:** Automatically prompts registration for unrecognized NFC cards.
- **Duplicate Scan Prevention:** Prevents multiple entries from the same card within a short period.
- **Real-Time Logging:** Stores attendance with timestamps in Excel or database format.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Modern interface built with Python Tkinter for easy admin management.
- **Secure Data Storage:** Keeps user details and attendance logs safely.

## Technologies Used
- Python (core application logic)
- Tkinter (Graphical User Interface)
- NFC Reader hardware (via `nfcpy` or similar libraries)
- Excel / SQLite (data storage using `pandas` and `openpyxl`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-xcity/nfc-attendance-pro.git
   cd nfc-attendance-pro
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The GUI will open. Admin can:

   * Start the attendance system.
   * Register new users when scanning unrecognized NFC cards.
   * Track attendance in real-time with timestamped logs.

## Future Improvements

* Add reporting and analytics for attendance trends.
* Implement user management features (edit/remove users).
* Enhance security with data encryption and access control.
* Optimize GUI responsiveness with multi-threading for NFC scanning.
* Switch fully to SQLite for robust data handling.
